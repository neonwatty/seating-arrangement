# Public Launch Preparation

## Overview

Preparing TableCraft for organic public sharing across multiple markets. The goal is to remove internal beta positioning, create benefit-driven messaging, and enable measurement of market interest.

## Target Audiences

### Primary Markets (highest intent)

1. **Wedding Planners & Couples** — Wedding seating is emotionally charged (family dynamics, relationship management). The relationship optimization feature directly addresses this pain.

2. **Corporate Event Coordinators** — Conference seating, company dinners, team offsites. They need to manage large guest lists and often have constraints (executives near front, departments grouped).

3. **Professional Event Planners** — Galas, fundraisers, award ceremonies. They handle multiple events and would benefit from templates and efficiency.

### Secondary Markets

4. **Restaurant Private Events** — Rehearsal dinners, birthday parties. Smaller scale but high frequency.

5. **Academic/Institutional** — Graduation dinners, faculty events, alumni gatherings.

## Strategy

### Multi-Market Positioning

Rather than focusing on one market initially, we cast a wider net to discover where the strongest signal comes from. The core pain point is universal across all markets:

> "Seating arrangements are stressful because relationships matter and logistics are tedious."

The landing page remains market-neutral while showing breadth through a use case row. Distribution (e.g., Reddit posts) can be tailored to specific audiences.

### Discovery Channels

| Channel | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Reddit - r/weddingplanning | "Made a free tool for seating charts that keeps couples together and family apart" |
| Reddit - r/eventplanning | "Free seating chart tool with relationship-aware optimization" |
| Reddit - r/SideProject | "Built a drag-and-drop seating planner, looking for feedback" |
| Reddit - r/webdev | Technical angle for developer feedback |
| Organic Search | SEO via meta tags with multi-market keywords |

### Measuring Interest

- Email capture on landing page to build waitlist and gauge engagement
- Google Forms integration for simplicity (can upgrade later)
- Track which distribution channels drive the most signups

## Success Criteria

1. Landing page feels "finished" enough to share publicly
2. Email capture functional to measure interest
3. SEO basics in place for organic discovery
4. Clear value proposition that resonates across markets
